# mass-translator

## About
Input english text, then translate it between languages *n* times using the [Deep Translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator) Python Library. 


## How to Use
Install dependencies
`pip install -r pip.req`


OPTIONAL: Get http(s) proxies, and fill them into the list in main.py


Paste/Type your text when prompted. **All text must be in a single line. Text with line breaks will not work**


Input the number of Iterations the text will be fed through. You will need fewer iterations for less text. 


You will be able to see the language used, number of iterations so far, and text.


**TODO:** Show English text here


## Planned Features
~~English text shown whilst translating, so you can see how the text is changing~~ Completed, although it is slower

~~Language Groups - Only use a few select languages~~ Added, follow the templates in __lang_groups.json__

Colors? Bit annoying, idk if I will add it

~~Import proxies from file~~ I don't think the program even supports multiple proxies
