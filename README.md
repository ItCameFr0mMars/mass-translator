# mass-translator

## About
Input english text, then translate it between languages *n* times using the [Deep Translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator) Python Library. 


## How to Use
Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


OPTIONAL: Get http(s) proxies, and add one to the list in `main.py`


Paste/Type your text when prompted. **All text must be in a single line. Text with line breaks will not work**


Input the number of Iterations the text will be fed through. You will need fewer iterations for less text. 


You will be able to see the language used, number of iterations so far, and text.



## Planned Features

Some sort of settings/config page?


Import text from files


Proxies are kinda unessicary, but I might add them


Pyperclip


Export text
